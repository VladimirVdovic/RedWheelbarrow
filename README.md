# RedWheelbarrow
Repository used to learn React Native app development. You can follow a more detailed process on [my blog](https://definitely-not-vlad.com/).

## UI Toolkit

For my choice of UI toolkit, I've decided to work with NativeBase. I've had prior experience with Shoutem's UI toolkit, however, I wish to leverage the newest versions of React Native at the moment and therefore I've resorted to Native Base.

```ShellSession
$ npm i native-base --save
```

## Authentication

The first thing I wanted to learn how to implement was Authentication. Realistically, the app user's first interaction with the app will most likely be the authentication screen, which allows the user to sign in/up.
